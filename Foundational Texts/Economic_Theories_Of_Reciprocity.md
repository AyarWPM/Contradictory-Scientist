# Economic Theories Of Reciprocity

## Foundations Of Reciprocity Economics
### Foundational Text on the Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory Approach to Reciprocity
#### Summary:
This document defines and explores the theoretical approach to reciprocity, deeply rooted in the dynamic logic of the contradictory (DLC) developed by Stéphane Lupasco. Unlike traditional economic theories focused on transactions and utility, this framework presents reciprocity as a fundamental principle underlying all forms of institutional modalities. It delves into the psychic and ethical dimensions of reciprocity, viewing it as a foundational matrix for understanding the essence and ethical values of coordinated human activities.
#### Keywords:
Reciprocity, Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory, Institutional Modalities, Ethical Values, Psychic Energy, Consciousness, Human Activities, Social Structures.
#### Detailed Sections:
- **Introduction to Theoretical Foundations**
   - **Philosophical Underpinnings**: Describes how the dynamic logic of the contradictory explores concepts such as knowledge, consciousness, and affectivity.
   - **Distinction from Traditional Economic Approaches**: Clarifies that this theory does not directly engage with traditional economic concepts like resource allocation. Instead, it profoundly impacts the economic realm through its mechanisms of resource distribution based on reciprocal dynamics.
- **Conceptual Framework of Reciprocity**
   - **Definition of Reciprocity**: Reciprocity is defined as the process of interaction between consciousnesses or perceptions. These belong to the realm of psychic matter, which is the contradictory dynamic between physical and biological matters, according to Lupasco's philosophy.
   - **Consciousnesses of Giving and Receiving**: These consciousnesses can be characterized as consciousnesses of giving and receiving, forming dualities and giving rise to the three dynamics: positive, negative, and contradictory.
   - **Structures of Reciprocity**: Identifies various structures of reciprocity observed in different cultures, perpetuating ethical values through societal institutions like marriage, rituals, hunting, and fishing.
   - **The Contradictory Space**: Explains how reciprocity creates a "contradictory space" where the opposing forces of giving and receiving coexist, leading to a state of inherent contradiction as per Lupasco’s logic.
- **The Principle of Reciprocity and Its Implications**
   - **Fundamental Principle**: The theory of reciprocity posits that the consciousnesses interacting go simultaneously through the contradictory dynamic, which is why they experience a common affectivity. This shared affectivity becomes the foundation for symbolic representations and ethical values.
   - **Affectivity and Ethical Matrix**: Elaborates on how reciprocity, when fully actualized, manifests as pure affectivity or a spiritual power within the participants, representing Lupasco's concept of the included third.
- **Generalization of Institutional Forms**
   - **Unified Framework**: All institutional modalities can be seen as manifestations of the principle of reciprocity, thus providing a unified framework for analyzing economic behaviors.
   - **Integration into Broader Economic Activities**: Other economic integrations like redistribution and market exchange are viewed under the umbrella of reciprocity, seen as specific instances or particular cases of the broader principle.
- **Reciprocity as a Matrix of Meaning and Ethical Values**
   - **Coordination of Human Activities**: Reciprocity acts as the core matrix from which all human cooperative activities derive their meaning and ethical significance.
   - **Ethical and Social Implications**: This conceptualization of reciprocity influences the understanding of ethical values in economic and social interactions, highlighting its role in shaping human behavior beyond mere economic transactions.
- **Implications for Economic Theory and Practice**
   - **Broadening Economic Models**: The potential implications of this theory for broadening traditional economic models to include ethical and cooperative dimensions as foundational aspects.
   - **Application Across Disciplines**: The generalized principle of reciprocity can be applied in various disciplines to enhance the understanding of human interactions, from economics to anthropology and beyond.
#### Conclusion:
This approach to understanding reciprocity extends beyond economic or social transactions, framing it as a profound ethical and psychic phenomenon that shapes and is shaped by collective consciousness and ethical norms. Future applications of this theory could span various fields intersecting economics, psychology, and ethics, offering a comprehensive understanding of human interactions.
#### Examples:
- **Shipibo Society**: Ethnological studies reveal the deep-rooted reciprocal practices in the Shipibo society, where marriage, rituals, and communal activities perpetuate ethical values.
- **Modern Applications**: Examining how modern community-based organizations implement reciprocal principles to foster ethical and sustainable economic practices.
#### Relevant Questions:
1. How does this approach to reciprocity redefine traditional economic theories?
2. What are the implications of viewing reciprocity as a psychic and ethical phenomenon?
3. How can the principles of reciprocity be applied to modern societal and economic structures?

### Foundational Text on Capitalism and Reciprocity Systems: A General Introduction
#### Summary:
This foundational text provides a comprehensive understanding of the dualistic nature of capitalism and reciprocity systems. It explores key differences in property ownership, monetary institutions, democracy, exchange mechanisms, competition, and decision-making. The text contextualizes the user's inquiries within this framework, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between these systems as viewed through the lens of the Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory (DLC).
#### Keywords:
capitalism, reciprocity systems, property ownership, monetary institutions, democracy, exchange mechanisms, competition, decision-making, dualistic characterization, common property, personal property, right of use
#### Detailed Sections:
**Context and Relevance:**
Capitalism is characterized by private property, the use of money as a commodity for exchange, and representative democracy. In contrast, reciprocity systems are based on common property, personal property, and the right of use, using the Internet to make value visible, participatory and direct democracy, and voluntary transfers within structures of reciprocity. These systems emphasize the interplay of psychic processes and shared affective experiences, leading to collective decision-making. Understanding these dualities is crucial for analyzing their impacts on society and individual behavior.
**Details of Concepts and Practices:**
- **Capitalism**:
  - **Private Property**: Ownership of resources and means of production by individuals or corporations, including public property managed by the state as a decisional entity, falls under the category of personal property.
  - **Monetary Institutions**: Money as a commodity used for exchange, which operates independently of individual will once integrated into the system.
  - **Representative Democracy**: Governance through elected representatives, which contrasts with the participatory and direct democracy of reciprocity systems.
  - **Contractual Exchanges**: Transactions based on legal agreements, bilateral and obligatory, as opposed to voluntary and free transfers in reciprocity systems.
  - **Agonistic Competition**: Competitive behavior aimed at eliminating rivals, as opposed to socially contextualized and harmonizing competition in reciprocity systems.
  - **Decisional Entities**: Organizations as economic or political subjects, influencing individual perceptions and decisions.
- **Reciprocity Systems**:
  - **Common Property, Personal Property, and Right of Use**:
    - **Common Property**: Resources managed collectively, accessible to all members of the community.
    - **Personal Property**: Items possessed and used by individuals, which can be donated back to common use.
    - **Right of Use**: Rights attributed to individuals based on their role in the production chain. Workers hold the right of use during production, which is transferred to distributors and ultimately to the final user, maintaining common ownership.
  - **Institution of the Internet**: Used to make value visible and facilitate voluntary transfers, in contrast to the monetary system in capitalism.
  - **Participatory and Direct Democracy**: Decision-making processes involving direct participation of individuals, rather than through elected representatives.
  - **Voluntary Transfers**: Free and voluntary acts that contribute to the structure of reciprocity, not necessarily reciprocated immediately.
  - **Contextualized Competition**: Functional and social competition, such as local games, that harmonize social dynamics rather than eliminate rivals.
  - **Reciprocal Interactions**: Decision-making as a product of interactions between psychic processes, shared experiences, and symbolic references, rather than purely individualistic processes.
**Practical Implications:**
Recognizing reciprocity as a foundational anthropological principle for symbolic function and human understanding can humanize capitalism but does not resolve its inherent issues, rooted in its institutions and norms. The risk of applying reciprocity within capitalism is its monetization, instrumentalization, and subsequent subversion by capitalist dynamics, maintaining existing power relations.
- **Theoretical and Political Recognition**:
  - Acknowledge the theoretical and political fields, as well as territorial spaces, where an economic policy of reciprocity can be applied.
  - The pertinent territorial level for a reciprocity system is a region encompassing an urban center and a rural periphery, with sufficient population and space.
- **Systemic Transition Dynamics**:
  - **Territorial Application**: Within the defined territory, reciprocity institutions are applied, addressing ownership and use rights dynamically along the production chain.
  - **Sustainable Transition**: Recognizing the possibility of a progressive and peaceful transition between systems, facilitated by international coordination under the United Nations' long-term systemic transition project.
  - **Political Decision**: This transition necessitates political, collective, and democratic decisions, requiring the development of political parties globally with the intention to coordinate systemic change when they gain power.
- **Global Coordination**:
  - To achieve a planetary-scale transition from capitalism to reciprocity systems, political movements worldwide must align to implement these changes regionally and internationally.
#### Conclusion:
The dualistic characterization of capitalism and reciprocity systems reveals the interplay between private property and common property, monetary institutions and the Internet, representative and participatory democracy, and contractual exchanges versus voluntary transfers. Recognizing these dynamics highlights the need for a theoretical, political, and territorial approach to apply reciprocity systems effectively. This involves a progressive and peaceful systemic transition facilitated by democratic decision-making and international coordination, ultimately aiming for a more equitable and sustainable global society.
#### Examples:
1. **Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA)**: Farmers receive direct support from consumers, who in return get fresh produce. This model combines capitalist efficiency with the social benefits of reciprocity.
2. **Cooperative Businesses**: Owned and operated by their members, cooperatives focus on mutual benefit and shared ownership, blending aspects of both economic systems.
3. **Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)**: Communities exchange goods and services without using money, fostering local resilience and social cohesion.
#### Relevant Questions:
1. How can elements of reciprocity systems be integrated into capitalist economies to enhance social equity?
2. What are the potential drawbacks of relying solely on voluntary transfers in a modern economy?
3. How do different cultures balance the dualities of capitalism and reciprocity?

  - **Theoretical Developments**: Explores how game theory in the 1970s, through economists like Hammond and Kurz, began to acknowledge that pro-social behavior could stabilize as an equilibrium in social interactions among self-interested players.
- **Integration of Psychological Models in Economic Theories**
  - **Influence of Behavioral Studies**: Examines how the integration of psychological models in economic experiments throughout the 1980s (cited works by Roth, Malouf, Murningham, Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze) demonstrated that individual choices often reflect a sense of justice or equity, weakening the stronghold of the self-interest hypothesis in economic theory.
  - **Social Preferences**: Discusses the conceptual shift towards recognizing pro-social or social preferences that include the welfare of others alongside individual consumption, termed as "social preferences."
- **Reciprocity in Economic Science**
  - **Conceptual Evolution**: Traces how the concept of reciprocity, though not central in the scientific innovations of the 1970s, was shaped by these experimental findings and the implications for rationality hypotheses concerning pro-social preferences.
  - **Technical Definition and Symbolic Form**: Defines the technical and symbolic forms of reciprocity developed during this period, distinguishing it from the anthropological principle largely ignored in economic sciences except by scholars like Karl Polanyi.
#### Conclusion:
Summarizes how the experimental approach has extended economic analysis from individual rationality to encompass reciprocity, highlighting its role in enriching traditional economic narratives with more complex and realistic human behaviors.
#### Examples:
- **Ultimatum Game**: Early experiments showed that many participants would reject unfair offers, indicating a preference for fairness over personal gain.
- **Public Goods Game**: Demonstrated that individuals are willing to contribute to the collective good even at a personal cost, reflecting pro-social preferences.
#### Relevant Questions:
- How do experimental findings on reciprocity challenge traditional economic models?
- What are the implications of social preferences for economic policy?
- How can experimental methods be used to further study pro-social behavior in economics?

It highlights the shift towards recognizing reciprocal behaviors influenced by perceived kindness or malice, and the implications of these behaviors in economic interactions.
#### Keywords:
Behavioral Economics, Game Theory, Reciprocity, Social Interactions, Strategic Behavior, Kindness, Malice, Economic Models.
#### Detailed Sections:
1. **Introduction to Behavioral Approaches in Economics**:
   - **Overview**: Discusses the predominance of the formal notion of reciprocity from the late 20th to early 21st century, focusing on mutual transfers motivated by more than just private interest, including altruistic and culturally motivated transfers.
   - **Behavioral Basis**: Outlines the principle that understanding these transfers requires a focus on choices and behaviors rather than solely on outcomes.
2. **Game Theory and Reciprocity**:
   - **Basic Framework**: Describes the conceptual framework of game theory used to analyze interactions among agents, focusing on individual strategies and the resulting gains from various strategic combinations.
   - **Central Hypotheses**: Discusses the key assumptions of interdependence, rational choice, and utility maximization in game theory, and how these are adapted to incorporate cultural and other context-specific variables.
3. **Modeling Reciprocity in Game Theory**:
   - **Reciprocity Games**: Introduces the concept of reciprocity games, such as the model by Falk and Fischbacher (2006), which integrates behavioral assumptions into classical game setups like the ultimatum game.
   - **Behavioral Assumptions**: Explains the behavioral hypothesis that reciprocity is a response to perceived kindness or malice, where kindness includes fairness in distribution and equity intentions.
4. **Mathematical Formulations and Logical Representations**:
   - **Kindness and Reciprocation Terms**: Defines the 'kindness term' which measures the perceived positivity or negativity of another's actions and the 'reciprocation term' which quantifies the response to perceived kindness.
     - \( \text{Kindness Term} \): \( k_j = \text{perceived impact of person j's action on person i} \)
     - \( \text{Reciprocation Term} \): \( r_i = \text{response of person i to the kindness of person j} \)
   - **Formal Definitions of Reciprocity**: Uses logical formulations to represent reciprocal interactions:
     - Positive reciprocity: \( (a \rightarrow^B b) \Rightarrow (b \rightarrow^B a) \)
     - Negative reciprocity: \( (a \rightarrow^M b) \Rightarrow (b \rightarrow^M a) \)
     - The \( \Rightarrow \) symbol denotes implication, illustrating that kind behaviors lead to kind responses, and malicious actions lead to retaliatory responses.
5. **Implications and Applications**:
   - **Economic Phenomena**: Discusses the empirical applications of reciprocity in labor economics, such as its role in wage rigidity and differential efforts in labor markets, citing studies by Fehr and Gächter (1998) and McCabe et al. (1996).
   - **Ethical and Cultural Dimensions**: Connects the concept of reciprocity to ethical principles found across major religions, emphasizing the natural human inclination towards reciprocating perceived attitudes.
#### Conclusion:
Highlights the significance of the behavioral approach in enriching economic theories with more nuanced understandings of human interactions and motivations, stressing the role of perceived social behaviors in shaping economic decisions and relationships.
#### Examples:
1. **Wage Negotiations**:
   - **Kindness in Wages**: When employers offer fair wages, employees reciprocate with higher productivity.
   - **Malice in Wages**: Unfair wages lead to decreased motivation and higher turnover rates.
2. **Consumer Behavior**:
   - **Kindness in Customer Service**: Excellent customer service results in customer loyalty and positive reviews.
   - **Malice in Customer Service**: Poor service leads to complaints and loss of business.
#### Relevant Questions:

## Introduction To The Energetic Approach To Reciprocity
### Foundational Text on the Synthesis of Reciprocity Theories: Integrating Classical Economic Models with DLC Approach
#### Summary:
This foundational document synthesizes traditional economic theories of reciprocity with the innovative DLC approach proposed by Dominique Temple and Mireille Chabal. While classical economic models focus on materialistic and monetary aspects of reciprocity under the assumption of methodological individualism, Temple and Chabal introduce a relational and energetic approach grounded in the dynamic logic of the contradictory (DLC). This synthesis extends the analysis beyond mere economic transactions to include psychic energies and collective consciousness that emerge from reciprocal interactions.
#### Keywords:
Reciprocity, Economic Theories, Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory, Dominique Temple, Mireille Chabal, Psychic Energy, Collective Consciousness, Symbolic Values, Ethical Values.
#### Detailed Sections:
- **Introduction to Traditional Economic Theories of Reciprocity**
   - **Overview of Classical Assumptions**: Discusses how traditional economic theories conceptualize reciprocity based on methodological individualism, focusing on individual behaviors and material exchanges. Reciprocity is typically viewed through the lens of classical logic as an individual attribute, such as a preference attribute.
   - **Limitations of Economic Models**: Highlights the limitations of these models in addressing the origins and development of preferences, often treating them as exogenous to the economic systems.
- **Dominique Temple and Mireille Chabal's Relational Approach**
   - **Foundations in the Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory**: Introduces Temple and Chabal's approach, which utilizes DLC to explore the interdependencies and relational dynamics inherent in reciprocity. This approach integrates the analysis of different levels of reality that participate in reciprocity relations.
   - **Focus on Psychic Energies**: Describes how their approach considers reciprocity as an exchange of psychic energies among participants, transcending the traditional focus on material transactions.
- **Synthesis of Economic and Psychic Perspectives**
   - **Materialistic vs. Psychic Analysis**: Contrasts the materialistic implications in classical economic theories with the DLC approach that includes psychic phenomena like consciousness, mental formations, and affectivity.
   - **Endogenization of Preferences**: Discusses how Temple and Chabal's approach endogenizes preferences by situating them within broader psychic phenomena, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how reciprocal relations shape and are shaped by individual and collective consciousness.
- **Implications for Understanding Reciprocity**
   - **Beyond Monetary and Symbolic Representations**: Explores how incorporating psychic energies and collective consciousness into analyses of reciprocity offers a deeper understanding of the ethical and symbolic values that emerge from these interactions.
   - **Integration of Economic and Ethical Values**: Examines how the synthesis of economic and psychic approaches enriches our understanding of reciprocity, suggesting that economic behaviors are deeply intertwined with broader social and ethical dimensions.
#### Conclusion:
Advancing Economic Theories of Reciprocity: Summarizes the contributions of Temple and Chabal in broadening the scope of economic theories to include non-materialistic aspects of human interactions. Future Directions: Proposes future research directions that could further explore the intersections of economic transactions and psychic energies within the framework of reciprocity.
#### Examples:
- **Traditional Economic Reciprocity**: Analyzing market exchanges where individuals trade goods and services based on perceived utility.
- **DLC Approach to Reciprocity**: Examining how mutual perceptions and affective states influence the dynamics of giving and receiving, leading to collective ethical values.
#### Relevant Questions:

### Foundational Text on Contrasting Classical and DLC Approaches to Reciprocity in Economic Sciences
#### Summary:
This foundational document contrasts the classical economic approach to reciprocity with the Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory (DLC) approach developed by Dominique Temple and Mireille Chabal. It explores how traditional economic theories conceptualize reciprocity primarily as a form of exchange in terms of individual decision-making and transactions, while Temple and Chabal's approach views it as a dynamic interplay of psychic interactions governed by principles that transcend individualistic perspectives.
#### Keywords:
Reciprocity, Classical Economic Theory, Dynamic Logic of the Contradictory, Dominique Temple, Mireille Chabal, Agents in Economics, Principle of Reciprocity.
#### Detailed Sections:
- **Introduction to Reciprocity in Classical Economic Theories**
   - **Agent-Based Reciprocity**: Defines the classical economic view where reciprocity is seen as a form of exchange between decision-making units (agents), encompassing individuals or groups. This view focuses on economic transactions such as transfers, gifts, and services.
   - **Relevant Agent Characteristics**: Discusses aspects relevant to the economic analysis of reciprocity in classical theories, including actions, sentiments, information asymmetries, uncertainties, expectations, memory, attitudes, cultural traits, and preference structures.
- **Temple and Chabal’s DLC Approach to Reciprocity**
   - **Foundational Principles**: Introduces the DLC approach, which centers on the Principle of Reciprocity as defined by the dynamic logic of the contradictory.
   - **Logical Representation**: Explains how this approach uses logical terms (such as "giving" and "receiving") that satisfy the fundamental postulate of DLC, focusing on interactions that are not solely transactional but involve deeper psychic and ethical dimensions.
- **Contrasting Classical and DLC Theories**
   - **Focus on Material vs. Psychic Interactions**: Contrasts the materialistic focus of classical theories with the psychic interaction focus of the DLC approach. Classical theories emphasize tangible outcomes and utility maximization, while the DLC approach highlights the interplay of psychic interactions that influence motivations and outcomes.
   - **Individualism vs. Relational Dynamics**: Analyzes how classical theories rely on methodological individualism, assuming exogenous preferences, whereas the DLC approach adopts a relational stance, viewing preferences as endogenous and emerging from dynamic interrelations among agents.
- **Implications for Understanding Reciprocity**
   - **Broader Implications of the DLC Approach**: Discusses how the DLC approach expands the understanding of reciprocity to include collective consciousness and the emergence of symbolic and ethical values through interactions.
   - **Integration of Theories**: Proposes how insights from the DLC approach can be integrated into classical economic models to enrich the analysis and application of reciprocity in diverse economic and social contexts.
#### Conclusion:
Summarizes the need for economic theories to evolve by incorporating broader, more complex models of human interaction that account for both material and psychic phenomena. Suggests areas for further research that could explore the integration of classical economic principles with the dynamic logic of the contradictory to provide a more holistic understanding of reciprocity.
#### Examples:
- **Agent-Based Reciprocity**: Classical examples include market exchanges where individuals trade goods and services based on perceived utility.
- **DLC Approach**: Examining how mutual perceptions and affective states influence the dynamics of giving and receiving, leading to collective ethical values.
#### Relevant Questions:
1. How do classical and DLC approaches to reciprocity differ in their conceptualization of human interactions?
